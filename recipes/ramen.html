         <h3>
         <ol>
          <p>
             <li>Combine steak and soy sauce in a plastic container with a lid.
                  Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours.
            </li>
         </p>
         <p>
             <li>Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess.
                Discard the remaining marinade.
             </li>
           </p>
           <p>
             <li>Heat coconut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. 
                 Add steak and cook until firm and reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
                  An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium-rare. 
                 Remove from skillet and allow to rest for 10 minutes.
             </li>
            </p>
            <p> 
             <li>While the steak is resting, combine broth, miso paste, garlic, and sesame oil in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil.
                  Once broth is at a slow boil, add ramen noodles. Cook until noodles are soft, about 3 minutes. 
                 Season with salt and pepper.
             </li>
            </p>    
            <p>            
                <li>Transfer broth and noodles to 2 bowls.
                     Slice steak and place on top.
                </li>
            </p>
         </ol>
